- 👋 Hi, I’m @MojiTom
- 👀 I’m interested in: web development (just finished a full-stack bootcamp w/ the MERN stack), game development (noobish), and network security (curious - not even a noob).
- 🌱 I’m currently working to improve my JavaScript skills (... and learning Scratch 3.0 for fun & to help the kiddos learn to code).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites and web apps w/ the MERN stack.
- 📫 How to reach me: ... contact info coming soon ...
